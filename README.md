The Fair Share tells individuals their fair share when paying for expenses. It is also a tool for financial simulations and planning to ensure a healthy
financial life for you and those you love. Whether that is showing how much each member of your family/friend group should spend on housing, cars, bills, etc.
or demonstrating the immense power of compound interest and the potential wealth-building of setting money aside through investments.

We have the philosophy that fairness is dependent on income. 
Consider this example, two individuals are splitting the cost of rent which is $1,000/month with individual one making $20,000 a year and individual two making $100,000
a year. You might think that each individual should pay $500 a month, as that is what is considered even and fair. 
Wrong! One's ability to contribute finicial is of course based on income and one's ability to
prosper in our modern economy is dependent on disposable income. Therefore, we believe that the proper allotment would be $167 for individual one and $833 for individual two. This means that both individuals pay 
the same percentage of their income on rent and have the same percentage of disposable income to pursue their interests. We believe that for any relationship where money is exchanged to be successful, whether it is platonic
or romantic, you must recognize that we are not all created equal when it comes to income.

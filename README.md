The Fair Share tells individuals their fair share when paying for expenses. We have the philosophy that the definition of fair changes with income. 
For example, if two individuals were splitting the cost of a $1,000 trip with individual one making $20,000 a year and individual two making $100,000
a year we would believe that the proper allotment would be $167 for individual one and $833 for individual two. This means that both individuals pay 
the same percentage of their income for the trip. We believe that for any relationship where money is exchanged to be successful, whether it is platonic
or romantic, you must recognize that we are not all created equal when it comes to income.
